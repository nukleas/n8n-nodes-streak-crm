## Credentials

To use this node, you need an API key from Streak CRM.

### How to get your API key:

1. Log in to your Streak account at [streak.com](https://streak.com)
2. Go to **Settings** > **API** 
3. Copy your API key

In n8n, create a new credential of type **Streak CRM API** and enter your API key.

## Compatibility

This node was developed and tested with n8n version 1.0.0 and uses Streak API v1 and v2.

## Usage

### Example: Creating a new pipeline and adding a box (deal)

This is a simple workflow to create a pipeline and then add a box to it:

1. **Streak CRM node** with operation **Create Pipeline**
   - Set name: `New Sales Pipeline`
   - Optional: Add description, team key, and other properties

2. **Streak CRM node** with operation **Create Box**
   - Use the pipeline key from the previous node
   - Set name: `Potential Client`
   - Optional: Add stage key and other properties

### Example: Triggering a workflow when a box changes stage

1. Add a **Streak Trigger** node
   - Set scope to **Pipeline** and select your pipeline
   - Set event to **Box Change Stage**
2. Activate the workflow — it will now run automatically whenever a box moves between stages

### Example: Managing contacts and linking them to boxes

1. **Streak CRM node** with operation **Create Contact**
   - Set email: `client@example.com`
   - Add fields for name, organization, etc.

2. **Streak CRM node** with operation **Update Box**
   - Use an existing box key
   - Link the contact by updating field values
